        <h2>Are Shrimp Kabobs Healthy?</h2>
        <p>Yes, they are. These skewers will provide you with plenty of protein from the shrimp and with such an abundance of ingredients, thereâ€™s no shortage of micronutrients. We also serve them with cooked potatoes, a healthy complex carb that we should all include in our diet.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shrimp.</li>
                    <li>Marinade:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lime juice.</li>
                            <li>Italian seasonings and thyme, for a complementing fragrance.</li>
                            <li>Red pepper flakes, paprika, and cayenne to give both a kick and an appetizing red color.</li>
                            <li>Salt and pepper.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Red onion.</li>
                    <li>Red bell pepper.</li>
                    <li>Zucchinis.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place 20 oz potatoes into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on medium for 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, coat 14 oz peeled shrimp with 2 tbsp lime juice, 1 tbsp Italian seasonings, 1 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, toss 6 oz green zucchini, 6 oz yellow zucchini, 6 oz red bell pepper, 4 oz green bell pepper, and 4 oz red onion with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp oregano.</li>
                    <li>Thread skewers with the shrimp and veggies. You should make about 16 kabobs in total (4 per serving), each having about 2-3 shrimp in between the veggies.</li>
                    <li>Heat a grill pan over medium heat. Use 2 tbsp butter and the remaining oil (2 tbsp) to grill the kabobs, 5 minutes per side. We did it in 3 batches, taking 30 minutes in total.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle 2 tbsp parsley on top and serve with cooked potatoes and 4 tbsp ketchup.</li>
                </ol>
