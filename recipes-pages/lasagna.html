        <h2>The perfect dish for a special ocasion</h2>
        <p>Homemade lasagna is the best. It tastes nothing like the ones from the frozen food aisle. This recipe is so good—it’s the kind of lasagna people write home about! It brings together all of the things we love in a good pasta dish: noodles, cheeses, fresh herbs and a delicious meat sauce. If you’ve never made lasagna before or haven’t found a good recipe, you have come to the right place.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pasta: lasagna noodles.</li>
                    <li>Water: to cook the pasta. You should preserve the pasta water to cook the bolognese later.</li>
                    <li>Main protein: lean ground beef.</li>
                    <li>Seasonings: minced garlic, paprika, Italian seasoning, oregano, and garlic powder.</li>
                    <li>Vegetables: onions, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes.</li>
                    <li>Condiments: tomato paste, tomato sauce, red wine, </li>
                    <li>Spices: sugar, salt, and ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Dairy: unsalted butter, whole milk, parmesan, and mozzarella cheese</li>
                    <li>Herb: parsley, for garnish.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the lasagna: In a large pot or deep pan, fill it with water and bring to a boil. Add the lasagna and cook for half the time on the packet. (Ours cooked for 4 minutes.) Once finished, drain the lasagna but don’t throw away the pasta water. Preserve 1 ½ cup of this water to make the bolognese sauce.</li>
                    <li>Sauté the beef: In a dry medium saucepan, add ground beef and sauté over medium heat for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cook the seasonings: In the same saucepan, add the minced garlic, paprika, Italian seasoning, dried oregano, garlic powder, ground black pepper, tomato paste. Stir for 1 minute to “wake” the spices.</li>
                    <li>Sauté the vegetables: Add the onions, bell peppers, carrots, and chopped tomatoes to the saucepan. Continue cooking over medium heat for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Deglaze the pan: Add the red wine, tomato sauce, sugar, and ¼ tsp salt. Stir and scrape the bottom of the saucepan.</li>
                    <li>Cook the bolognese: Add the preserved 1 ½ cup pasta water to the saucepan. Turn up the heat to high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes or until half of the water is reduced. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Make the white sauce (bechamel sauce): In a clean, small saucepan, add the unsalted butter and flour. Whisk until the flour is dissolved. Continue to add milk while whisking. Whisk constantly until the sauce thickens. Add the remaining ¼ tsp salt and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the lasagna: In a deep baking dish, spread a spoonful of the bolognese into the bottom of the dish. Continue to layer with the white sauce, lasagna sheet, another layer of bolognese, and finish it off with the white sauce.</li>
                    <li>Bake the lasagna: Wrap the top of the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake in the middle of a preheated oven at 375°F for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the cheese: Add grated parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella on top of the lasagna. Bake again for 10 minutes at 430°F on the top rack.</li>
                    <li>Serve: Remove the lasagna from the oven. Allow to cool at least 15 minutes before cutting into the lasagna. Transfer to serving plates, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve.</li>
                </ol>
